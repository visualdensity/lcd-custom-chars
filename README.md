# LCD Custom Chars

A simple and ugly site (both styles and code!) as a part of learning
to use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) for an upcoming project.

This little app is a pixel editor for creating custom characters to
use with a typical 16x2 LCD screen. The code generated is specific to
[Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) though.
