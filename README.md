# LCD Custom Chars

This little app is a pixel editor for creating custom characters to
use with a typical 16x2 LCD screen in your [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc)
project. Just create the piece you want using the grid on the left and
copy the resulting code on the right into your Aruidno file.

Remember to update the `customChars` name to whatever suits! For more
reference on customChars, please refer to http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystalCreateChar

A simple and ugly site (both styles and code!) as a part of learning
to use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) for an upcoming project.
